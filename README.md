# Go-Blockchain

This project is an implementation of a toy blockchain to gain further understanding on how blockchains are implemented and the technical challenges that arise.
This project will eventually include a basic blockchain implemented with Go and a block explorer implemented with eithe TypeScript or Rescript. :)
